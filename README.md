# CityBikeTrends

I selected the data for the month of July in the year 2016 for my trend analysis for the Citi Bike Program. The total data was in 2 different csv files so I first added the 2 files and then performed some cleaning, converting and preparations on the combined data. This was done in the Jupyter Notebook in this repo named '2016_July.ipynb'. I have put comments wherever necessary for anyone to understand my work.
The Tableau workbook also has trend analysis and description for every dashboard.
